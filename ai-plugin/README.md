# AI Plugin

This plugin adds an AI prompt to Headlamp. It works by including some of the context of what happens around the
Kubernetes cluster as part of the prompt history, in a transparent way.

It works with AzureOpenAI or the OpenAI servers and needs the user's own API key.

**IMPORTANT:** This plugin is in early development and is not yet ready for production use. Using it may incur
in costs from the AI provider! Use at your own risk.
