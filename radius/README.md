# Radius

The Radius plugin provides a way to visualize and manage Radius applications. It builds upon the work of [Radius](https://radapp.io/) .

Radius is a cloud-native application platform that enables developers to collaborate with platform engineers to deliver and manage cloud-native applications across public clouds and private infrastructure.

The Radius Headlamp plugin provides comprehensive views in Headlamp for Radius applications, environments and other Radius resources.
The plugin adds a new item (Radius) to the sidebar to give the user an overview of the Radius installation on the cluster.

## Radius Installation

Please refer to the [official installation guide](https://docs.radapp.io/tutorials/install-radius/) for Radius to learn how to install it.

## Plugin Installation in Headlamp for Desktop
