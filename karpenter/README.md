## Karpenter Headlamp Plugin

This Headlamp plugin adds **Karpenter-specific custom resources** to the Headlamp UI, helping users visualize, understand, and manage **autoscaling decisions** in a more intuitive way.

### Supported Karpenter Deployments

The plugin automatically detects and supports multiple Karpenter deployment types:

* **EKS Auto Mode** - AWS managed Karpenter with `NodeClass` resources (`nodeclasses.eks.amazonaws.com`)
* **Self-installed Karpenter** - Standard Karpenter installation with `EC2NodeClass` resources (`ec2nodeclasses.karpenter.k8s.aws`)
* **Generic Karpenter** - Other Karpenter installations with `NodeClass` resources (`nodeclasses.karpenter.sh`)

### Features

#### Current Features

    * Shows key attributes (subnet selectors, IAM role, etc.)
    * Status and condition rendering in a human-readable format
    * Supports both `NodeClass` (EKS Auto Mode) and `EC2NodeClass` (self-installed) resources
* **NodeClaim & NodePool Support:**
    * View and inspect NodeClaims and NodePools
    * See constraints like CPU, requirements, disruption etc.
    * Real-time status monitoring and configuration details
* **Pending Pod Dashboard:**

    * Includes schema validation and diff preview
* **Metrics Integration:**
    * Prometheus integration for comprehensive metrics visualization
    * Resource Usage, Allowed Disruptions and Pending Pods visualization (NodePools)
    * Creation Rate and Provisioning Latency visualization (Scaling View)
* **Maps View:**
    * See relationship between Karpenter Resources like NodeClasses, NodePool and NodeClaims with core Kubernetes resources like Pods, Nodes etc.
* **Automatic Deployment Detection:**
    * Automatically detects EKS Auto Mode vs self-installed Karpenter
    * Adapts UI and resource handling based on detected deployment type
    * No manual configuration required

### Getting Started with Karpenter on EKS

The plugin works with both EKS Auto Mode and self-installed Karpenter:

#### EKS Auto Mode (Recommended)
* **üìò [EKS Auto Mode Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/automode.html)**
* Uses AWS-managed Karpenter with `NodeClass` resources
* Automatically detected by the plugin

#### Self-installed Karpenter
* **üìò [Karpenter Official Setup Guide](https://karpenter.sh/docs/getting-started/getting-started-with-karpenter/)**
* Uses `EC2NodeClass` resources that you manage
* Requires manual installation and configuration

The plugin automatically detects which deployment type you're using and adapts accordingly.

#### How Detection Works

The plugin examines available Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) in your cluster:

1. **EKS Auto Mode**: Detected by presence of `nodeclasses.eks.amazonaws.com` CRD
2. **Self-installed Karpenter**: Detected by presence of `ec2nodeclasses.karpenter.k8s.aws` CRD  
3. **Generic Karpenter**: Detected by presence of `nodeclasses.karpenter.sh` CRD

Detection happens automatically when the plugin loads, with no configuration required.
